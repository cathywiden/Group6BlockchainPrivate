Updates

User "cathy" has extra features available to her -- she can hack blocks to test if validateChain() works. She can also see all users' all blocks.

Other users can only see their own blocks and can't hack blocks.

**BUILD A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED WEB APPLICATION PROTOTYPE**

**Short summary**

We have built a prototype for a product that fetches your location from your current IP-adress and/or user entered data (city/country), called "GeoMI". 

When you are logged in, you have the option to save your location data together with your user id and timestamp to a blockchain. There is an open validation functionality to ensure transparency - anyone at any time can validate the chain's integrity. 


**Background**

The main target group for this product would be the transportation industry, a sector that in recent years has struggled to meet documentation needs stemming from increasing regulation pressure. We anticipate a demand for a blockchain solution that offers an automated logging service of driving time and route.


**Method**

The product is built in a browser run environment using Javascript. 


**Applications and future implementations**

There are multiple ways of developing this product further according to match different customer needs. 

For example, the transportation industry could implement it to securely and efficiently storing driving records. Mobile app features could be added to automatically fetch your location, for example every 5 mins, and generate a route that could be looked at by internal regulation, invoicing office, HR etc. Such a solution would also make it possible to minimize the risk of manual tampering of records and/or bypassing EU-regulations around driving hours. 

Another transportation-related use could be delivery of goods from producer to client. By adding a QR-code to the item you could easily track the transportation route to be able to estimate delivery times in real-time, and also to track where the item gets stuck should it fail to be delivered.
